One of the best parts of being a web developer is being able to tinker with the sites/applications that I visit on the web. I'm able to block network requests that I'm not a fan of, edit the styling of elements on any page with a little bit of CSS or Javascript, implement features with WebExtensions that I need that the sites/applications don't provide me like Vim keybindings in my browser for easier keyboard navigation. 

Javascript and the web have a lot of clunky, hacky, and strange parts to it. People often say that Javascript and the open web are a mess of cobbled together features and protocols. However, I prefer to look at the web as a *beautiful mess* that *still* is a place that is truly open to anyone that dares to try and tame it.

It is true that several big corporations like Google (Google the search engine, Google Chrome the world's most popular browser, Google Cloud Platform the cloud hosting platform, Firebase the cloud database), Microsoft (Microsoft Edge the browser built on Chrome, Azure the cloud hosting platform, Typescript the superset of Javascript, VSCode the editor of choice for web devs), and Facebook (React the most popular web frontend UI library), Apple (Safari the web browser and only mobile web browser on iOS), and Amazon (AWS the cloud hosting platform) have a huge stranglehold over many of the most commonly used services and tools for the web. However, if you have enough patience and determination, anyone can learn how to program for the web, host projects on the web, and manage services on the web fully from scratch if they wanted or on other smaller hosting platforms. It takes just enough elbow grease, patience, and time to make that happen.

The same cannot be said for platforms like iOS/MacOS or Android. In order to *just get started publishing an app* to the App Store on iOS or MacOS, you have to pay a $100/year license fee to Apple just to *try* to publish your app. Both Android and iOS require a manual review process by Apple and Google to be approved before your app can be distributed to their app stores. On the web, no one but yourself stands in the way of getting a project online.

It's only become easier to get started with companies like Netlify who have implemented a feature on their platform where you can simply drag-and-drop a folder of HTML/CSS/JS into your browser and BAM your site is live. That takes almost all barriers of entry for hosting a site online out of the way for people brand new to the web. It's incredible that features like that even exist to me. Even I, who would 99% of the time rather use a CLI to handle deployments like that, *still* use that feature because it's just so darn easy to get a site live! I did that for a single-file HTML website that I put online so that I could easily access my favorite coffee recipes on any device. All I needed was a single HTML file to make that happen with some inline `<style>` tags, no fancy bundler, front-end framework, build pipeline, nope! I just wanted to get a webpage live online and it was done in a matter of 5 minutes.
